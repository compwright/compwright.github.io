When you spend your days staring at PHP code, you really can appreciate a visual refresh now and then. Syntax highlighting, if done well, makes reading code much easier. Excellent color schemes are not only functional, but are visually appealing as well.

Personally, I think Eclipse PDT&#8217;s PHP syntax highlighting is quite boring. I have tried several custom color schemes, but here is one I particularly like.

Do you have syntax color schemes you like? Post them in the comments.
