If you have ever written a PHP command line script and tried to pass a file to it using the POSIX tilde (`~`) shortcut to reference your home directory, you may have been surprised to learn that the operating system does not automatically expand tildes in paths.

You&#8217;ll get an error like this:

    Warning: fopen(~/file.csv): failed to open stream: No such file or directory

Fortunately, it is an easy matter to perform tilde expansion, once you know you need to.

    function expand_tilde($path)
    {
        if (function_exists('posix_getuid') && strpos($path, '~') !== false) {
            $info = posix_getpwuid(posix_getuid());
            $path = str_replace('~', $info['dir'], $path);
        }
    
        return $path;
    }
