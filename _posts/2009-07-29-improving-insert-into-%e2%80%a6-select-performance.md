INSERT INTO&#8230;SELECT locks the table being read by the SELECT statement due to MySQL 5.0&#8217;s statement-based replication. Here&#8217;s a great post from the MySQL Performance Blog explaining the problem in detail and what to do about it.

Note: this problem is supposed to be eliminated when using MySQL 5.1 row-based replication.

I thought it would be interesting to see how the Drizzle developers where handling this scenario in their high-performance, high-concurrency remake of the MySQL. Below is an e-mail I got back from Jay Pipes on the subject:<!--more-->

Basically, when you do a INSERT INTO&#8230;SELECT query it has to lock the table being selected or replication doesn&#8217;t work right (see http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/07/12/insert-into-select-performance-with-innodb-tables/). This is horrible for concurrence, because other clients are locked out until the SELECT is finished, which can be a while, depending on the query.
