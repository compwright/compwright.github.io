Tuesday I stopped along the way as I was approaching Birmingham at a Chick-fil-a for lunch. Some creative florist had furnished all the tables with these flowers. They are not fake:

Birmingham, Alabama is a very pretty place to be, with a mountain ridge on each side. While we were driving back from church yesterday I was able to catch a few shots with my camera. These shots really don&#8217;t do it justice. The scenery is very nice, and there are some absolutely beautiful ridges along the tops of the ridges. What a view that must be!
