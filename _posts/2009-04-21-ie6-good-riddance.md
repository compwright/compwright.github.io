Ivan over at [SimpleBits](http://creativebits.org/webdev/finally_microsoft_putting_ie6_death) says:

> Today IE6&#8217;s browser market-share is between 10-20% depending on the statistics you look at and it&#8217;s still large enough for companies to require compatibility. This number was dropping by about 1% in the last 6 month. And hopefully with the update to be released in the coming weeks IE6 will drop below 5% within 2-3 month. At that point we can disregard IE6 altogether finally putting an end to the misery.

I can&#8217;t wait!
