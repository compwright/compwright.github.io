Tonight I had need access a remote server through the excellent <a href="http://copilot.com" target="_blank">Fog Creek Copilot service</a>. Copilot supports Windows 2000 and later and Mac OS X, and I&#8217;m not running Windows anymore&#8230;

But that wasn&#8217;t a problem, because the Copilot helper executable runs just dandy under <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>.
