I&#8217;m a big believer in readability, and I love to write code that is easy to understand. Check out my newly-posted [MySQL Style Guide](/coding-for-readability/mysql-style-guide/) which covers:

  * Simple queries
  * Complex queries
  * Subqueries
  * UNIONS
  * Advanced queries

Useful tips:

  * Use table aliases sparingly and only when absolutely necessary (a few extra keystrokes now will save you hours of gazing at cryptic queries later)
  * CAPITALIZE keywords religiously
  * Whitespace and tabs are your friends!
