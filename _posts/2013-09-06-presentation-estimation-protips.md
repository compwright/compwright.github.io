Estimation is a topic which is extremely important to running a successful software development company, whether you are a digital agency (like <a href="http://brandmovers.com" target="_blank">Brandmovers</a>) or a freelancer working solo.

I was honored to be the featured speaker for the <a href="http://atlantaphp.org/september-2013-meeting/" target="_blank">September 2013 meeting</a> of the <a href="http://atlantaphp.org/" target="_blank">Atlanta PHP User Group</a>. The slides are below in case you missed it. If you are interested in the topic, there is supporting documentation below for reference.

## Description

You’re an expert developer, peacefully composing code into a profoundly elegant masterpiece, when suddenly your boss rushes in with the Next Big Idea that will Revolutionize The Way People Use The Internet. He’s on his way to pitch to a VC, and stops by to describe the Idea in excited terms. After a 30 second elevator pitch, he pops the question: “So, Peter, how long do you think it will take to build this thing-a-ma-bob?”

What do you say?

These eight Protips will cover your back, save your job, and keep your boss’s shirt.
