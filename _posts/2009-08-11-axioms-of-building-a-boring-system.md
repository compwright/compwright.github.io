From a [presentation from Percona](http://www.percona.com/ppc2009/PPC2009_Boring_MySQL.pdf). This should be on every developer&#8217;s wall:

  1. If it worked 10, 20, 30 years ago, it is worth considering.
  2. If a crisis makes you come alive, you have your priorities wrong.
  3. If you are working on urgent system problems, it&#8217;s not a boring architecture.
  4. You should be working on exciting new things that serve your customers and are otherwise unimportant.
