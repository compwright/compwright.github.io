I&#8217;m here at <a href="http://phpcon.org" target="_blank">PHPCon</a>, the first PHP community developer conference in Nashville, TN. The first day consisted of two rather lengthy workshops, both of which were very informative.

## Web Services

This talk was given by <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/" target="_blank">Lorna Jane Mitchell</a>, whose totally awesome British accent I could listen to all day. I consider myself no novice on consuming web services, but being a relative newcomer to _building_ web services, I got a real education on how to do it right.

Key takeaways:

  * **Use curl**, it eliminates points of failure for more accurate testing. Lorna rejects any bug ticket that does not come with a curl test case, which reduced support requests by 50%!
  * Every web service should have a **heartbeat method** that echos the variables you pass to it.
  * Every web service should have **documentation**, (real) **examples**, and a **support mechanism**. If you&#8217;re not going to do this, don&#8217;t bother building a web service, &#8217;cause nobody&#8217;s gonna use it.
  * **Utilize the HTTP protocol** as fully as possible, including HTTP **headers** (Accept, Content-Type, User-Agent), **verbs** (GET [read], POST [create], PUT [update], DELETE [delete]), and **status codes** (HTTP 200, 201, 301, 302, 400, 401, 403, 404, and 500).
  * **Give consumers a choice of formats**. text/html is useful for debugging purposes.
  * **Parse the Http-Accept header** and deliver content in first format listed that you support.
  * Don&#8217;t confuse **HTTP 401** with **HTTP 403** (&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who you are, so I&#8217;m denying access&#8221; vs &#8220;I know who you are, and you don&#8217;t have permission&#8221;).
  * <a title="PHP PECL HTTP module documentation" href="http://us.php.net/http" target="_blank"><strong>pecl_http</strong></a> is an easier way to access web services than <a title="PHP CURL module" href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php" target="_blank">curl</a>.
  * **Error handling defines API quality**. Provide complete, useful, and consistent error messages **in the expected response format**.

## Frontend Caching

This talk was given by <a href="http://helgi.ws/" target="_blank">Helgi Þorbjörnsson</a> (I will not even attempt his Icelandic surname). Helgi is a long-time PEAR contributor and experienced front-end developer. Key takeaways:

  * **80% of response time is spent downloading resources.**
  * **Don&#8217;t abuse cookies**. Large cookies hurt performance because of slow upload speeds, and because they are sent with _every_ request. When you use cookies, be sure to set an expiration date and limit them to only the domains they are needed on.
  * Browsers have **per-domain concurrent download limits**. You can spread static assets across 3-4 multiple subdomains as a workaround.
  * **Combine files judiciously**. Be aware of the trade-off between fewer server requests and larger file size.
  * **Load above the fold first**.
  * **Minify** Javascript and CSS, preferably at build time.
  * Use **gzip compression**_only_ for text-based content.
  * Save HTTP 404 bandwidth by ensuring that you have a **robots.txt** file and a **favicon**.
  * **Compress images more** (Photoshop doesn&#8217;t cut it; better alternatives include <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">pngcrush</a> and <a href="http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/" target="_blank">jpegtran</a>).
  * Test with slower connections (tread the user&#8217;s path).
