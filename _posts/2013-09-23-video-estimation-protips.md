[Software Estimation Pro Tips](http://vimeo.com/75124779) from [Atlanta PHP User Group](http://vimeo.com/atlantaphp) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

You’re an expert developer, peacefully composing code into a profoundly elegant masterpiece, when suddenly your boss rushes in with the Next Big Idea that will Revolutionize The Way People Use The Internet. He’s on his way to pitch to a VC, and stops by to describe the Idea in excited terms. After a 30 second elevator pitch, he pops the question: “So, Ricky, how long do you think it will take to build this thing-a-ma-bob?”

What do you say?

In this September 5, 2013 presentation, Jonathon Hill (@compwright) presents ten Pro Tips that will cover your back, save your job, and keep your boss’s shirt. Jonathon is the Director of Development at Brandmovers (www.brandmovers.com), and a steering committee member of the Atlanta PHP User Group.
